                <img src="pngs/11.jpg" alt="maincharacter">
                <p>A souls-like game made by the big men who made Dark Souls. Though easier than Dark Souls, it's still a fun challenge at times. Am a big fan of the character customization as I could really distort the face. Also looks really good while also running good on a computer that isn't top tier.</p>

        <h3>Why I like this game</h3>
            <div class="content-block" id="camp">
                <img src="pngs/6.jpg" alt="camp">
                <p>I personally am a big fan of difficult games. Not difficult in that there is pvp and everybody who plays has no life and I get destroyed, but through actually being a difficult game at times, whether it be mechanics or hard enemies.</p>

                    <li>An Epic Drama Born from a Myth Created by George R.R. Martin
The founding mythology of Elden Ring was written by George R. R. Martin and adapted into a rich multilayered story. Intersecting goals and desires between the characters create an intense narrative that weaves throughout the Lands Between. The events of the game can unravel in many ways, depending on your interventions.

The Tarnished community is massive and active. Your friends may already be among them. You can play with up to two other Tarnished as your cooperative teammates, either by inviting them using a shared password or by summoning them from a pool of nearby community members.
There are also ample opportunities to face off against other players, either through co-op invasions, invited duels, or the many player battle options available in the three Colosseums.</p>
