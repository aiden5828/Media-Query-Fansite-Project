        <h3>Summary of the Boss</h3>
            <div class="content-block" id="aura">
                <img src="pngs/2.jpg" alt="aura">
                <p>The first major boss in the game and one of the more difficult. He leaves little room to attack, expecially because I was using greatswords, so one mistake meant I might get comboed and die. My strategy was using the extra optional companion to bait all his attacks until he died so I could get as many hits in.</p>
            </div>
        
        <h3>Moveset</h3>
            <div class="content-block" id="gettingjumped">
                <img src="pngs/4.jpg" alt="gettingjumped">
                <p>He has very basic attacks which are simple to dodge, but he also has some more faster paced ones which are tight to time. Sometimes he hits you with a jump attack and gives the illusion of an opening just to hit you with a quicker melee attack. Hes also got a sledgehammer which one-shot me if I got hit which sucked. He has 2 phases which alter his attack pattern enough to mess with you if you're not ready.</p>

        <h3>Finally Winning</h3>
            <div class="content-block" id="winning">
                <img src="pngs/10.jpg" alt="winning">
                <p>As the first major boss in the game, you'd think it'd be easier but it's one of the more difficult ones that took me more time than the second major boss. They give you an optional extra companion to help for a reason. Took me maybe 20 tries and I finally won.</p>

            <p>Beating as much as I can in the project time while taking pictures, it was very difficult to get pictures during the boss fights, which is a big portion of the game</p>
